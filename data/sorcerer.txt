Breath of the Void

Close-quarters spell

Daily

Target: One nearby enemy; breath spell

Hit: 2d12 x 10 + Charisma negative energy damage, and the target moves down 2d6 points in initiative order, to a minimum of 1.

Calling the Blood

Close-quarters spell

Daily

Effect: Randomly select an icon (preferably a sorcerous one). You gain some surprising or bizarre magical effect associated with the power of that icon to assist you. The effect is entirely up to the GM, though the immediate impact of the spell should always be favorable for you. The long-term consequences of randomly invoking the power of an icon that may be an enemy might not be favorable for you, and should be played for narrative interest by the GM, particularly if the impact of the spell was huge for you. Since this is a daily spell, sizeable impact is fine, but don’t award any extra effect for empowered casting, especially since the spell can be cast effectively out of combat.

Epic Feat Randomly choose twice, then choose the single result you prefer.

$

Silver Flame

Close-quarters spell

Daily

Quick action to cast

Effect: Roll your relationship dice that you have with a sorcerous heroic icon. For each 6 you roll, you gain one 7th level or lower spell from any spellcasting class that you can cast this battle. For each 5 you roll, you gain one 5th level or lower spell from any spellcasting class that you can cast this battle. If the escalation die is 5+, you can swap the escalation die for one or your rolls. If you get no successes, you regain the spell after this battle. You can acquire one of the new spells the same round you cast this spell. Then select and acquire any other gained spells at the start of your next turn. You can use your Charisma as the ability score that provides the acquired spells’ attack bonuses and damage bonuses (if any). Other ability score references remain unchanged. As you might expect, each 5 you roll also invokes an icon-related complication or obligation in the tradition of rolling 5s on relationship checks.
