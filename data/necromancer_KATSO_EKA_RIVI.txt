Speak with Dead

Ranged spell

Variable

Special: You can use this spell 1d3 times each day (roll during a full heal-up when you take it). Each time you use the spell, you must wait 1d6 hours before casting it again.

Target: One corpse you are touching that has been dead less than a day. Note that creatures that were undead for a longer period before they were killed are not legal targets.

Effect: You can ask the corpse a number of yes/no questions that the leftover fragments of personality/spirit within the corpse will attempt to answer truthfully using the information it had when it died.* The magic uses the caster’s knowledge of language so no translation is needed. The first question is free. The second question requires a DC 15 necromancy skill check using Intelligence if the corpse is “friendly,” and Charisma if the corpse is not. Increase the DC by +5 for each subsequent question after the second. If you’re using this spell during battle, each question and answer requires a round.

Note: Just as with the séance ability of the Death Priest talent, there’s always a 10% chance that the spirit summoned is going to lie to you for reasons best known to it and to the GM. The GM rolls a d20 secretly before the corpse provides any answers; a 3+ means the spirit will speak truly, but a 1 or a 2 means it will lie while appearing to be aiming for the truth.

5th level spell: You can now cast this spell 1d4 times per day, targeting corpses or even just heads that have been dead up to a week.

7th level spell: Questions can now be phrased to receive three-word answers, targeting corpses/heads that have been dead up to a month.

9th level spell: Questions can now be phrased to receive one to two sentence answers, targeting corpses/heads or skeletal remains of almost any age.

5th level spell: You can now summon a wight.

7th level spell: You can now summon a barrow wight.
